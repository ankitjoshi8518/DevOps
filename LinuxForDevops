mkdir   # makes new directory
mkdir folder; cd folder ; touch file  # run multiple command in shell with semilon
mkdir -p /temp/folder1/logs   # create directory tree in single command

mv oldfile newfile  #moving file.. if file is moved in the same directory, it is the same file with new name. so there is no separate command for rename

######### WORKING WITH VI TEXT EDITOR

vi filename.txt   # by default, we enter the command mode in vi editor. here we can write command like x to delete a character and dd to delete entire line .. /text to find text
#VI commands
# x to delete a letter, dd to delete entire line
# yy to copy entire line, p to paste it
# scroll up or down - ctrl u and ctrl d
# :w to save the file, :w filename to specify the filename
# :q to quit without saving changes
# :wq to quit saving changes
# finding stuff - /findthisword   .. use n to move cursor to the next occurance

# whoami - displays current logged in user
# id - displays the userid and group id that user belongs to
# su username - switch to another user
# ssh username@ip
# /etc/sudoers file to add the user as root user
# curl https://urltodownloadfile -O     # downloading file from the internet
# wget https://urltodownloadfile -O filename.txt    #downloading file from the internet
# ls /etc/*release*   # view the OS release version
# cat /etc/*release*  # view details about the operating system

#Package managers .. rpm stands for redhat package manager. dependencies are not installed with rpm
rpm -i package.rpm  # installs package
rpm -e package.rpm  # uninstalls package
rpm -q package.rpm  # queries the package and provide details about it

# yum uses rpm and installs all dependencies
yum install ansible
cat /etc/yum.repos.d  
yum repolist # lists the repositories on a system
ls /etc/yum.repos.d/  # this folder contains the file. It shows the file where the repositories are configured
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo # shows the URL where all packages are stores
# yum might not install latest version of a software.. use the software documentation to see how the latest packages can be installed

yum list ansible  # shows installed and available packages
yum remove ansible #removes package
yum --showduplicates list ansible   # shows 
yum install ansible-2.4.4.4 # installing specific package version

# Managing daemons in Linux
systemctl start httpd
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl status httpd
systemctl enable httpd  #configure service to start at OS startup
systemctl disable httpd # disables auto service start upon system restart

#setup the application as service
/etc/systemd/system   # this file stores all the daemons
/usr/lib/systemd/system/app.service create a file here, servicename.service 
In the unit file write the command below:
  
  [Unit]
  Description= Running script as service 
  
  [Service]   # this is called section
  ExecStart=command to run the program    # this is called directive
  ExecStartPre=/temp/pre.sh   # specify the script to run before starting the service
  ExecStartPost=/temp/post.sh # specify script to run after starting the service
  Restart=Always  # restart service automatically if it crashes
  
  [Install]   # in this install section, specify the service to startup after native OS service startup
  WantedBy=multi-user.target    # service can start after this multi-user.target is started. But systemctl enable servicename is required  
  
THat's it. 
Use systemctl daemon-reload to tell the system to load the additional service that has been setup
use systemctl start servicename from hereon
systemctl cat app.service   # view config file for service


#NETWORKING

ip link   # list interfaces on linux system
ip addr   # view ip addresses on an interface
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
route   #display's kernel routing table
ip route add 192.168.2.0 via 192.168.1.1  # add gateway ip address
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1      # default route or use 0.0.0.0/0
#put these in /etc/network/interfaces file to keep these settings after reboots
#By default a linux system does not forward traffic between its multiple interfaces on different networks
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward     # default is 0, set this to 1 and traffic will be forwarded within NIC's
#Above setting is not persistent between reboots, set net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf

cat /etc/resolv.conf    # set dns server here as:  nameserver 192.168.1.100
nameserver 192.168.1.100
nameserver 8.8.8.8
# by default name resolution in /etc/hosts file takes precedence
# this can be changed by changing content of a file: /etc/nsswitch.conf 
hosts: files dns      # file will take precedence over dns server
# search can also be added in /etc/resolv.conf file to append the domain name when trying to resolve internal DNS name
search domain.com  mydomain.com  prod.mydomain.com    # multiple domain names can be mentioned here
# using nslookup does not look for nameservers set in /etc/hosts file
dig www.google.com    #dns resolution testing toool with more capabilities than nslook

# Adding environment variable:
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk-13.0.2/bin
