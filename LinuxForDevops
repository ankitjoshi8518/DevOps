# :q to quit without saving changes
# :wq to quit saving changes
# finding stuff - /findthisword   .. use n to move cursor to the next occurance

# whoami - displays current logged in user
# id - displays the userid and group id that user belongs to
# su username - switch to another user
# ssh username@ip
# /etc/sudoers file to add the user as root user
# curl https://urltodownloadfile -O     # downloading file from the internet
# wget https://urltodownloadfile -O filename.txt    #downloading file from the internet
# ls /etc/*release*   # view the OS release version
# cat /etc/*release*  # view details about the operating system

#Package managers .. rpm stands for redhat package manager. dependencies are not installed with rpm
rpm -i package.rpm  # installs package
rpm -e package.rpm  # uninstalls package
rpm -q package.rpm  # queries the package and provide details about it

# yum uses rpm and installs all dependencies
yum install ansible
cat /etc/yum.repos.d  
yum repolist # lists the repositories on a system
ls /etc/yum.repos.d/  # this folder contains the file. It shows the file where the repositories are configured
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo # shows the URL where all packages are stores
# yum might not install latest version of a software.. use the software documentation to see how the latest packages can be installed

yum list ansible  # shows installed and available packages
yum remove ansible #removes package
yum --showduplicates list ansible   # shows 
yum install ansible-2.4.4.4 # installing specific package version

# Managing daemons in Linux
systemctl start httpd
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl status httpd
systemctl enable httpd  #configure service to start at OS startup
systemctl disable httpd # disables auto service start upon system restart

#setup the application as service
/etc/systemd/system   # this file stores all the daemons
/usr/lib/systemd/system/app.service create a file here, servicename.service 
In the unit file write the command below:
  
  [Unit]
  Description= Running script as service 
  
  [Service]   # this is called section
  ExecStart=command to run the program    # this is called directive
  ExecStartPre=/temp/pre.sh   # specify the script to run before starting the service
  ExecStartPost=/temp/post.sh # specify script to run after starting the service
  Restart=Always  # restart service automatically if it crashes
  
  [Install]   # in this install section, specify the service to startup after native OS service startup
  WantedBy=multi-user.target    # service can start after this multi-user.target is started. But systemctl enable servicename is required  
  
THat's it. 
Use systemctl daemon-reload to tell the system to load the additional service that has been setup
use systemctl start servicename from hereon
systemctl cat app.service   # view config file for service
